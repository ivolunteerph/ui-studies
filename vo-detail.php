						<p class="lead">Project PEARLS focuses its outreach efforts in the slum communities in Tondo, Manila, particularly in ULINGAN and Helping Land. Both communities sit on a dumpsite where children have no choice but to live with garbage, mosquitoes, flies, and vermin. Children and families in Ulingan also live on soot and around toxic smoke from the charcoal factories.</p>
						
						<p>Join us as we provide a hot and nutritious meal to over a hundred children.</p>
						
						<p>The event starts at 8am with Feeding the Kids. You will feed over 300 childres in Helping Lang and Ulingan. </p>
						
						<p>After every feeding, volunteeres will help in Brain Booster Activity with the Children in Ulingan and help them with homework, help them learn basic English, Math, Spelling, Reading, Writing Tutorial, Arts and Crafts, Story telling and fun learning games.</p>
